My .vim stuff
=============

If you want an exact copy of my vim setup, clone this folder into your .vim directory.

Then, edit your ~/.vimrc so that it has:

    :source ~/.vim/vimrc

somewhere in it (Actually, this is all mine has).

Also, if anyone knows why the submodules are all showing up in the root directory,
I'd love to know how to fix that (they should only be in bundles, I'd think?).
